I'm a Ph.D. Student at the [Computing Institute](http://www.ic.uff.br) of [Fluminense Federal University](http://www.uff.br/).  
My research area is software engineering, and my interests are software debugging (algorithmic debugging, statistical debugging), program understanding/comprehension and provenance.  
You can contact me through linhares.h@gmail.com or hlinhares@id.uff.br.
